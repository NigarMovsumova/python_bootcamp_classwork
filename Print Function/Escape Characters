Special Characters
Sometimes in Python we want to print a nice sentence in a special format, e.g. like a spreadsheet or table.

In such cases we use special symbols starting from a backslash symbol. Here it is - \. Most important symbols:

\n - new line.

\t - tab.

\" or \' - quotes inside a string.

\\ - backslash.
