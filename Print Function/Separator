Separator is a great tool to use inside prints with multiple arguments. Especially, with tables. Check this 2 lines:

print("Name\tSurname\temail\tPhone\tAddress\t")

print("Name", "Surname", "email", "Phone", "Address", sep="\t")


They produce the same result, but the code on a third line is much easier to read and can be rewritten by a program.

By default, sep is equal to blank, if you change the separator to sep = " ", there will be no changes.

As well, many outputs use \n for a new line or sep="-" or sep="_" incase you need to remove blanks, e.g. in website address.
